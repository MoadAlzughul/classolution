Heyzine Online PDF to Flipbook

===== Open in your computer =====
To open the flipbook locally on your computer:
1.-Uncompress the "flipbook.zip" (not the heyzine-flipbook.zip) file.
2.-Double click the heyzine.exe file.

Notes:
-The heyzine-flipbook.zip contains your flipbook data, it should be placed in the same folder of heyzine.exe without uncompressing it.
-If you have more than one flipbook you can place them all in the same heyzine.exe folder changing their name but keeping the "heyzine-" part.
 For example: heyzine-flipbook1.zip heyzine-catalog-2.zip


===== Upload to your site =====
1.-Uncompress the flipbook.zip file.
2.-Uncompress the heyzine-flipbook.zip file.
2.-Upload the flipbook folder, files folder, flipbook.pdf and index.html to a folder in your web server.
3.-It should work straight away, but make sure the urls from index.html are refering to the correct relative urls of your website. 
   You don't have to change any other file.
